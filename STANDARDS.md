# General

## Directory structure

Since a large AngularJS application has many components it's best to structure it in a directory hierarchy.


* Create high-level divisions by functionality and lower-level divisions by component types.

Here is its layout:

```
.
├── app
│   ├── app.js
│   ├── common
│   │   ├── controllers
│   │   ├── directives
│   │   ├── filters
│   │   └── services
│   ├── home
│   │   ├── controllers
│   │   │   ├── FirstCtrl.js
│   │   │   └── SecondCtrl.js
│   │   ├── directives
│   │   │   └── directive1.js
│   │   ├── filters
│   │   │   ├── filter1.js
│   │   │   └── filter2.js
│   │   └── services
│   │       ├── service1.js
│   │       └── service2.js
│   └── about
│       ├── controllers
│       │   └── ThirdCtrl.js
│       ├── directives
│       │   ├── directive2.js
│       │   └── directive3.js
│       ├── filters
│       │   └── filter3.js
│       └── services
│           └── service3.js
├── partials
├── lib
└── test
```

* In case the directory name contains multiple words, use lisp-case syntax:

```
app
 ├── app.js
 └── my-complex-module
     ├── controllers
     ├── directives
     ├── filters
     └── services
```

* Put all the files associated with the given directive (i.e. templates, CSS/SASS files, JavaScript) in a single folder. If you choose to use this style be consistent and use it everywhere along your project.

```
app
└── directives
    ├── directive1
    │   ├── directive1.html
    │   ├── directive1.js
    │   └── directive1.sass
    └── directive2
        ├── directive2.html
        ├── directive2.js
        └── directive2.sass
```

* Each JavaScript file should only hold **a single component**. The file should be named with the component's name.

Conventions about component naming can be found in each component section.

## Markup

Other HTML atributes should follow the Code Guide's [recommendation](http://mdo.github.io/code-guide/#html-attribute-order)

## Others

* Use:
    * `$timeout` instead of `setTimeout`
    * `$interval` instead of `setInterval`
    * `$window` instead of `window`
    * `$document` instead of `document`
    * `$http` instead of `$.ajax`

This will make your testing easier and in some cases prevent unexpected behaviour (for example, if you missed `$scope.$apply` in `setTimeout`).

* Automate workflow using:
    * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com)
    * [Bower](http://bower.io)

* Don't use globals. Resolve all dependencies using Dependency Injection, this will prevent bugs and monkey patching when testing.

* Do not pollute your `$scope`. Only add functions and variables that are being used in the templates.
* Prefer the usage of [controllers instead of `ngInit`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/4366/files). The only appropriate use of `ngInit` is for aliasing special properties of `ngRepeat`. Besides this case, you should use controllers rather than `ngInit` to initialize values on a scope. The expression passed to `ngInit` should go through lexing, parsing and evaluation by the Angular interpreter implemented inside the `$parse` service. This leads to:
    - Performance impact, because the interpreter is implemented in JavaScript
    - The caching of the parsed expressions inside the `$parse` service doesn't make a lot of sense in most cases, since `ngInit` expressions are often evaluated only once
    - Is error-prone, since you're writing strings inside your templates, there's no syntax highlighting and further support by your editor
    - No run-time errors are thrown
* Do not use `$` prefix for the names of variables, properties and methods. This prefix is reserved for AngularJS usage.
* When resolving dependencies through the DI mechanism of AngularJS, sort the dependencies by their type - the built-in AngularJS dependencies should be first, followed by your custom ones:

```javascript
module.factory('Service', function ($rootScope, $timeout, MyCustomDependency1, MyCustomDependency2) {
  return {
    //Something
  };
});
```

# Modules

* Modules should be named with lowerCamelCase. For indicating that module `b` is submodule of module `a` you can nest them by using namespacing like: `a.b`.

```javascript
angular.module('app.login', []);
```

# Controllers

* Do not manipulate DOM in your controllers, this will make your controllers harder for testing and will violate the [Separation of Concerns principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns). Use directives instead.
* The naming of the controller is done using the controller's functionality (for example shopping cart, homepage, admin panel) and the substring `Ctrl` in the end.
* Controllers are plain javascript [constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/constructor), so they will be named UpperCamelCase (`HomePageCtrl`, `ShoppingCartCtrl`, `AdminPanelCtrl`, etc.).
* The controllers should not be defined as globals (even though AngularJS allows this, it is a bad practice to pollute the global namespace).
* Use the following syntax for defining controllers:

  ```JavaScript
  ```

   Digging more into `controller as`: [digging-into-angulars-controller-as-syntax](http://toddmotto.com/digging-into-angulars-controller-as-syntax/)
* If using array definition syntax, use the original names of the controller's dependencies. This will help you produce more readable code:

  ```JavaScript
  function MyCtrl(s) {
    // ...
  }

  module.controller('MyCtrl', ['$scope', MyCtrl]);
  ```

   which is less readable than:

  ```JavaScript
  function MyCtrl($scope) {
    // ...
  }
  module.controller('MyCtrl', ['$scope', MyCtrl]);
  ```

   This especially applies to a file that has so much code that you'd need to scroll through. This would possibly cause you to forget which variable is tied to which dependency.

* Make the controllers as lean as possible. Abstract commonly used functions into a service.
* Avoid writing business logic inside controllers. Delegate business logic to a `model`, using a service.
  For example:

  ```Javascript
  //This is a common behaviour (bad example) of using business logic inside a controller.
  angular.module('Store', [])
  .controller('OrderCtrl', function ($scope) {

    $scope.items = [];

    $scope.addToOrder = function (item) {
      $scope.items.push(item);//-->Business logic inside controller
    };

    $scope.removeFromOrder = function (item) {
      $scope.items.splice($scope.items.indexOf(item), 1);//-->Business logic inside controller
    };

    $scope.totalPrice = function () {
      return $scope.items.reduce(function (memo, item) {
        return memo + (item.qty * item.price);//-->Business logic inside controller
      }, 0);
    };
  });
  ```

  When delegating business logic into a 'model' service, controller will look like this (see 'use services as your Model' for service-model implementation):

  ```Javascript
  //Order is used as a 'model'
  angular.module('Store', [])
  .controller('OrderCtrl', function (Order) {

    $scope.items = Order.items;

    $scope.addToOrder = function (item) {
      Order.addToOrder(item);
    };

    $scope.removeFromOrder = function (item) {
      Order.removeFromOrder(item);
    };

    $scope.totalPrice = function () {
      return Order.total();
    };
  });
  ```

  Why business logic / app state inside controllers is bad?
  * Controllers instantiated for each view and dies when the view unloads
  * Controllers are not reusable - they are coupled with the view
  * Controllers are not meant to be injected
  

* When you need to format data encapsulate the formatting logic into a [filter](#filters) and declare it as dependency:

   ```JavaScript
   function myFormat() {
     return function () {
       // ...
     };
   }
   module.filter('myFormat', myFormat);

   function MyCtrl($scope, myFormatFilter) {
     // ...
   }

   module.controller('MyCtrl', MyCtrl);
   ```


# Directives

* Name your directives with lowerCamelCase.
* Use `scope` instead of `$scope` in your link function. In the compile, post/pre link functions you have already defined arguments which will be passed when the function is invoked, you won't be able to change them using DI. This style is also used in AngularJS's source code.
* Use custom prefixes for your directives to prevent name collisions with third-party libraries.
* Do not use `ng` or `ui` prefixes since they are reserved for AngularJS and AngularJS UI usage.
* DOM manipulations must be done only through directives.
* Create an isolated scope when you develop reusable components.
* Use directives as attributes or elements instead of comments or classes, this will make your code more readable.
* Use `scope.$on('$destroy', fn)` for cleaning up. This is especially useful when you're wrapping third-party plugins as directives.
* Do not forget to use `$sce` when you should deal with untrusted content.

# Filters

* Name your filters with lowerCamelCase.
* Make your filters as light as possible. They are called often during the `$digest` loop so creating a slow filter will slow down your app.
* Do a single thing in your filters, keep them coherent. More complex manipulations can be achieved by piping existing filters.

# Services

This section includes information about the service component in AngularJS. It is not dependent of the way of definition (i.e. as provider, `.factory`, `.service`), except if explicitly mentioned.

* Use camelCase to name your services.
  * UpperCamelCase (PascalCase) for naming your services, used as constructor functions i.e.:

    ```JavaScript
    function MainCtrl($scope, User) {
      $scope.user = new User('foo', 42);
    }

    module.controller('MainCtrl', MainCtrl);

    function User(name, age) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
    }

    module.factory('User', function () {
      return User;
    });
    ```

  * lowerCamelCase for all other services.

* Encapsulate all the business logic in services. Prefer using it as your `model`. For example:
  ```Javascript
  //Order is the 'model'
  angular.module('Store')
  .factory('Order', function () {
      var add = function (item) {
        this.items.push (item);
      };

      var remove = function (item) {
        if (this.items.indexOf(item) > -1) {
          this.items.splice(this.items.indexOf(item), 1);
        }
      };

      var total = function () {
        return this.items.reduce(function (memo, item) {
          return memo + (item.qty * item.price);
        }, 0);
      };

      return {
        items: [],
        addToOrder: add,
        removeFromOrder: remove,
        totalPrice: total
      };
  });
  ```

* Services representing the domain preferably a `service` instead of a `factory`. In this way we can take advantage of the "klassical" inheritance easier:

	```JavaScript
	function Human() {
	  //body
	}
	Human.prototype.talk = function () {
	  return "I'm talking";
	};

	function Developer() {
	  //body
	}
	Developer.prototype = Object.create(Human.prototype);
	Developer.prototype.code = function () {
	  return "I'm coding";
	};

	myModule.service('Human', Human);
	myModule.service('Developer', Developer);

	```


# Templates

* Use `ng-bind` or `ng-cloak` instead of simple `{{ }}` to prevent flashing content.
* Avoid writing complex expressions in the templates.
* When you need to set the `src` of an image dynamically use `ng-src` instead of `src` with `{{ }}` template.
* When you need to set the `href` of an anchor tag dynamically use `ng-href` instead of `href` with `{{ }}` template.
* Instead of using scope variable as string and using it with `style` attribute with `{{ }}`, use the directive `ng-style` with object-like parameters and scope variables as values:

```HTML
<script>
...
$scope.divStyle = {
  width: 200,
  position: 'relative'
};
...
</script>

<div ng-style="divStyle">my beautifully styled div which will work in IE</div>;
```

# Routing

* Use UI-Router and specifiy states of the apps to handle routing.

* Consider decreasing number of network requests by bundling/caching html template files into your main javascript file, using [grunt-html2js](https://github.com/karlgoldstein/grunt-html2js) / [gulp-html2js](https://github.com/fraserxu/gulp-html2js). See [here](http://ng-learn.org/2014/08/Populating_template_cache_with_html2js/) and [here](http://slides.com/yanivefraim-1/real-world-angularjs#/34) for details. This is particularly useful when the project has a lot of small html templates that can be a part of the main (minified and gzipped) javascript file.
